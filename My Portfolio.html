          <h2>Personal Profile </h2>
          <p> My name is Sumaya Ahmed and I am an MSc Computing Student based in Cardiff with a great passion for Technology and User Experience Research.</p>
          <p> I am also a registered Midwife and qualified in 2020. I completed 2575 hours of practice placement and personally delivered 43 newborn babies which is one 
           of my biggest achievements. </p> 
          <p> Although Midwifery was rewarding, it wasn't the right career choice for me as I experienced burnout in the pandemic, luckily I found my passion for technology.  </p>

          <p> I also own a small online business which I am currently working towards developing a website for. This business doesn't take a lot of my time and allows me to earn 
            some money on the side as a student.  </p>
    
          <p> You can often find me travelling and learning about different cultures and languages. I am currently learning my fourth language and hope to be fluent very soon.</p>

       
        
        
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p> Over the last year through self study and my MSc Computing degree I have learnt the following technical skills: </p>
           <ul> 
             <li>JavaScript</li>
             <li>HTML</li>
             <li>CSS</li>
             <li>Python - Frameworks like Flask and Django</li>
             <li>Data Analysis - SQL</li>
             <li> Agile </li>
      
          </ul>
          
          <p> As well as the technical skills listed above, through work experience I have been able to pick up other skills needed in the workplace like communication, 
            teamwork, analytical skills and time management. </p>
        
        <p> One of the main things I enjoy about Computing is the creativity it allows me to explore and be curious about finding innovative solutions 
        to tech problems.</p>

        <p> Although I enjoy web development, I am particularly drawn to User Experience Research and was able to learn a lot more about it in my Human Centric Computing module by conducting 
          my own research and creating case studies. In these case studies I conducted User interviews, surveys and created user personas which you will be able to see below in the case study section. I also utilised
        different platforms to self study like YouTube and connecting with UX Researchers on LinkedIn to learn from them. One of my favoruite platforms I have used for UX Research so far is Usertesting.com as I was able to access
        the ebook which taught me a lot about conducting research.</p>

        <p> Altough working in the tech field is very different to working as a Midwife there are some similarities, for example, the multidisciplinary enviornment of both 
          the hospital and in the tech field. In the hospital I would work alongside many different healthcare professionals to achieve patient care and the same thing can be said 
          in tech. You work alongisde Software Engineers, UX Designers, UX Researchers, Product Managers and other essential individuals to ensure the user has an excellent experience. One of the 
        main reasons I became a midwife was being able to interact with people and empathise with them, out of all the roles in the tech field, I feel that UX Research allows me to display those skills.</p>
